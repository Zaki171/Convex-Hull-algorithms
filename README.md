# Convex-Hull-algorithms
The algorithms Jarvis March, Graham Scan and an Extended Graham Scan which are all used to compute the convex hull of a set of points.
The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon containing all of the points within it that can be formed.
We were tasked with implementing and analysing two algorithms to compute the convex hulls for randomly generated points: the Jarvis March, which in terms of time
complexity is the slower, greedier method, and the Graham Scan. We also added some simplifications to the Graham Scan, which involved removing some points 
we know would not form part of the hull to make the process faster.
